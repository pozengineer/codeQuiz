Summary

The application uses 'addEventListener' so that when one of the buttons is clicked on, it will
initiate the associated function. The use of 'preventDefault' and 'stopPropagation' methods are
used to prevent the window from going to it's default settings when the function is run and
prevents the clicked event from affecting the parent elements in the application.

The purpose of this application is to demonstrate the use of functions and 'addEventListener' so
that events are able to be delegated to different elements in an html file. In addition, implementing
responsive behaviour of html files using media queries. This enables the developer to create applications
that can be viewed on multiple devices and screen sizes such as:
- iphone
- Tablet
- Laptop
- Desktop

The following methods, objects and API's (Application programming Interface) were used in this web
application to demonstrate how javaScript can be used to apply calculations and functions to elements
in an html file:
- Arrays 
- Functions
- IF Statements
- addEventListener
- preventDefault method
- stopPropagation method
- Local Storage
